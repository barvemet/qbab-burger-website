## Issue: TSS Type Conversion Required

**Subject:** Convert Middleware TSE to Cloud TSE - TSS ID: df15a626-6b42-45ce-8016-9cb5083dae8a

**Dear Fiskaly Support Team,**

I am experiencing issues with my TSS configuration and need assistance.

### Current Situation:
- **TSS ID:** `df15a626-6b42-45ce-8016-9cb5083dae8a`
- **Current TSS Type:** Middleware TSE
- **API Key:** test_7adkqher3qb4g58zsu13dq097_q-bab
- **Environment:** Test/Sandbox

### Problem:
When attempting to access the TSS via the Cloud API, I receive the following error:
```
HTTP 432 - E_USE_MIDDLEWARE
"The requested resource is available only through the fiskaly sign Middleware"
```

### Request:
I would like to **convert this TSS from Middleware TSE to Cloud TSE** type so that I can access it directly via your Cloud API without requiring local middleware installation.

### Reason:
- I am deploying on Strato shared hosting with limited server access
- Cloud TSE would be more suitable for my deployment environment
- I cannot find middleware binaries to download and install

### Alternative:
If conversion is not possible, please provide:
1. Official download link for Fiskaly middleware binary (Linux amd64)
2. Installation instructions for the middleware
3. Configuration guide for Middleware TSE integration

### Contact Information:
- **Project:** Q-Bab Burger POS System
- **Deployment:** Strato Hosting (https://q-bab.de)
- **Email:** [Your email address]

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your name]
